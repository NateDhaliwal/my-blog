<h1>How Replit Killed Their Community</h1>

As briefly mentioned in my [first blog post](/NateDhaliwal-s-Blog/2024/12/13/My-First-Post.html), [Replit](https://replit.com) is an online IDE that uses cloud environments. They have a great IDE, and although they destroyed their free plan (a story for another post), they aren't *too* bad. <br>
They've slowly removed aspects of the community, starting with the ability to run repls (projects) from the Cover Page, then removing the ability to follow other users, and even removing the ability to comment on repls. <br>
Slowly, users left Replit and less junior coders used it. Some users joined Replit Ask (the support forum/community for Replit), but most left. A large portion setup [AMC](https://amcforum.wiki), a community-run forum of users from Replit who left. <br>
A while later, Replit shut down one of their most popular products, Teams for EDU, where teachers could teach coding to their students. No teacher was happy. There were many complaints and pleads to bring it back, some even saying that they would happily pay for it if it were brought back. However, this did not sway Replit's decision and another large chunk of Replit's users left. <br>
Replit pretty much destroyed the remaining users by putting them behind a pay wall, introducing [Replit Core](https://replit.com/replit-core). They killed the free plan by decreasing resources gradually before limiting them to only 3 repls (projects). This was the final straw. Replit destroyed their community. <br>
Now all that's left are programmers willing to pay $25 a month (or $120 a year). Replit's direction began going towards a more professional route, recently introducing Replit Teams, for enhanced collaboration. Junior coders (who were orginally Replit's target audience) have little place now. <br>
That's the story of how Replit did it. Great job, guys.
